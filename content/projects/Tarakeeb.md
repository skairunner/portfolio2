*Created on a team at the 2017 NYU New York University Abu Dhabi Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World.*

In accordance with the theme, we created a prototype of a grammar-teaching tool for children who are learning Arabic. Language acquisition involves trial and error of grammar constructs, getting feedback on incorrect grammar in order to better gain an idea of grammar.

For each lesson, the user is presented with Arabic words and grammar particles, and can click or tap each word to construct a sentence, and get feedback on whether the grammar was correct. The 'heart' of the engine, the grammar checker, was coded in Python, while the website was created using d3.js, jQuery and Bootstrap.

Our team placed shared 3rd out of 14 teams at the hackathon.
