This is the repository for my portfolio, hosted at [portfolio.skye.im](https://portfolio.skye.im).

# Building

Install hugo and run `hugo` in the root of this repository.

The installed hugo must have SASS support, and be version .41 or higher. Ubuntu/Debian `apt` may not have a recent-enough version, in which case hugo will have to be built frmo source.

# Development

Run `hugo server` in the root of the repository and navigate to `localhost:1313`.
